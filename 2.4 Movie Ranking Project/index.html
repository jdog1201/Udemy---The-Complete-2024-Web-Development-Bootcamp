<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3>
<p>My favorite marvel movie of all time. One of the first funny Marvel movie.</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Enough said. Captain America Mjolnir scene is perfect.</p>

<h3>Antman</h3>
<p>Paul Rudd is hilarous in this. I think I just like funny superhero movies.</p>
